<h1>Actions Panel</h1>
<img src="../img/dd_ap.jpg"/>
<p>
Actions panel allows to do some actions on the oscillators without having to do them individually
<ul>
<li>
Kill All - turn off immediately all the oscillators running (volume to 0.00 for all)
</li>
<li>
Volume Mul - apply multiplication factor selected to all the oscillators running
</li>
<li>
Event Edit - open the event editor
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Event Editor</h1>
<img src="../img/eed.jpg"/>
<p>
Event editor allows to perform actions on groups of oscillators.<br>
It preserve all the commands applied in memory files; files are stored in the "save" folder.<br>
When opened it load the last used memory file.
<ul>
<li>
New - create a new empty memory file
</li>
<li>
Open - open a mamory file
</li>
<li>
SaveAs - save current memory file with name
</li>
<li>
TakeSnap - save the current active oscillators parameters
</li>
<li>
File: - indicates memory file in use
</li>
<li>
History - a scrollable list of all commands appied (read only to consult and copy in "Command")
</li>
<li>
Command - a textbox to write the command
</li>
<li>
Do - the button to launch the command written in "Command"
</li>
</ul>
</p>



<h2>Commands</h2>
<p>
The basic command structure is:<br>
(N1 N2...)vWWpXXmYYtZZ<br>
where:
<ul>
<li>NX is the corresponding number of the oscillator(s), oscillators numbers must be within brakets and separated by space</li> 
<li>
v is the switch to provide volume information to oscillators, if omitted volume will not be changed
</li>
<li>
WW is a number (range 0.0 - 1.0) to provide volume value to oscillators, if switch is omitted volume will not be changed
</li>
<li>
p is the switch to provide pan information to oscillators, if omitted pan will not be changed
</li>
<li>
XX is a number (range 0.0 - 1.0 / 0.5 is center) to provide pan value to oscillators, if switch is omitted pan will not be changed
</li>
<li>
m is the switch to provide modulation information to oscillators, if omitted pan will not be changed
</li>
<li>
YY is an integer (from 0 to the lenght of the dropdown menu list) to provide modulation value to oscillators, if switch is omitted modulation will not be changed
</li>
<li>
t is the switch to schedule in the future actions to oscillators, if omitted action will happen immediately
</li>
<li>
ZZ is an float to provide the time (expressed as ratio of the global BpM) at wich action will happen
</li>
</ul>
Several oscillators group could be controlled with the same command, just put a semicolon between different actions group.<br>
Example:<br>
(55 66) v0.1p.1;(56 67) v0.1p.9
